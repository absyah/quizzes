### **Component Description**
#### **User**
- Represents the end-users who interact with the quiz platform through requests and receive responses, such as submitting answers and viewing the leaderboard.
#### **Next.js**
A framework for building server-rendered or statically generated React applications. It handles the client and server-side operations in this system:

1. **Client Components**:
    - **Role**: These are React-based components used in the user interface to display quizzes, leaderboards, and live score updates.
    - **Operations**: Handles read operations, such as retrieving quiz questions or leaderboard data, and sends requests for user interactions.
2. **Server APIs**:
    - **Role**: Backend endpoints created with Next.js API routes to process user submissions, such as posting answers with `[POST] /api/answers/submit` endpoint
    - **Operations**: Manages write operations for submitting answers, verifying their correctness, and assigning scores.
3. **Supabase Client Library**
    - **Role**: Acts as the bridge between the Next.js client and server components and Supabase services.
    - **Operations**: Facilitates database interactions, such as reading quiz data for client components and writing user answers.
#### **Supabase**
An open-source backend as a service (BaaS) platform providing database, authentication and real-time features:

1. **Realtime**:
    - **Role**: Enables real-time updates for quiz scores and leaderboard changes.
    - **Operations**: Uses WebSockets to push live updates to client components.
2. **Auth**:
    - **Role**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
    - **Operations**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure data access and interactions.
3. **APIs**:
    - **Role**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for interacting with the database.
    - **Operations**: Handles CRUD operations for user's answers.
4. **PostgreSQL**:
    - **Role**: The underlying relational database used by Supabase to store data persistently.
    - **Operations**: Holds data such as quiz questions, user information and leaderboard rankings.


### **Data Flow**
1. **User**: Initiates the process by interacting with the platform.
2. **Select Quiz**: The user selects a quiz using its unique ID.
3. **Questions Shown**: The selected quiz's questions are retrieved and displayed to the user.
4. **Answer Questions**: The user submits their answers.
5. **Get Score**: The system evaluates the answers and assigns a score.
6. **Leaderboard Calculated**: The leaderboard is updated based on the user's score and other participants' scores.
